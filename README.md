# SwasthaSetu üáÆüá≥ - AI-Powered Rural Healthcare

**SwasthaSetu** is a revolutionary mobile application designed to bridge the healthcare gap in rural India. It leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to provide fast, affordable, and accessible diagnostics for critical diseases like Pneumonia, Tuberculosis (TB), and Malaria, directly into the hands of community health workers.

## The Problem
Every year in India, millions of lives are tragically lost to treatable diseases. The core issue, especially in rural areas, is the lack of timely diagnosis due to the unavailability of specialist doctors and radiologists. This delay in detection is a critical bottleneck that costs lives.

## üíª Technology Stack

### Frontend (Mobile Application)
*   **Framework:** Flutter 3.x.x
*   **Language:** Dart
*   **Key Packages:**
    *   `http`: For making API calls to the backend.
    *   `image_picker`: For selecting images from the gallery or camera.
    *   `pdf`, `printing`: For generating, viewing, and saving professional medical reports.
    *   `flutter_spinkit`: For elegant loading animations.
    *   `path_provider`: For managing file paths to save reports.

### Backend (AI & API Server)
*   **Framework:** FastAPI
*   **Language:** Python 3.9+
*   **AI/ML Libraries:**
    *   `PyTorch`: For running the deep learning models (EfficientNet/ResNet).
    *   `Pillow`: For image preprocessing.
    *   `ONNX Runtime`: For optimized model inference.
*   **LLM Provider:** Sarvam AI (`sarvam-m` model) for Chatbot and Agentic AI features.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Deployment
*   **Platform:** Render
*   **Deployment:** The FastAPI backend is deployed as a web service on Render, providing a live API endpoint for the Flutter app.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system operates in a simple, robust client-server architecture:

1.  **Flutter App (Client):** Captures user input (images, patient data, chat queries).
2.  **API Request:** Sends a secure HTTPS request to our deployed backend on Render.
3.  **FastAPI Backend (Server on Render):**
    *   Receives the request.
    *   For image analysis, it preprocesses the image and feeds it to the PyTorch models.
    *   For chat queries, it forwards the request to the Sarvam AI API.
4.  **JSON Response:** The backend returns a structured JSON response containing the diagnosis, confidence scores, or chatbot text.
5.  **Flutter App (Client):** Parses the JSON and displays the information to the user in a clean, intuitive UI, or generates a PDF report.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

        static const String _sarvamApiKey = 'YOUR_SARVAM_AI_API_KEY_HERE';
        ```
    *   Open `lib/services/ml_service.dart`.
    *   Ensure the `_baseUrl` points to your deployed Render API.
        ```dart
        static const String _baseUrl = 'https://swasthasetu-medical-ai.onrender.com';
        ```
